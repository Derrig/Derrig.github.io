I have a passion for Android and open-source development.

Languages I enjoy working with include **Java, OCaml, Javascript, and Python**. I am currently learning Kotlin and Vala.

This spring, I am completing my junior year studying Computer Science at Cornell University. I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2019.
