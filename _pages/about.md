I have a passion for libre software and writing clean, performant code.

Languages I enjoy working with include **C++, Java, OCaml, and Python**.

I currently work at Facebook, where I develop Tally, a real-time highly distributed flash-backed counter service handling 
1 billion queries per second, providing statistics about streams of events. 
It is used by hundreds of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus teams for a wide range of purposes 
including abuse mitigation, virality tracking and story view counts.

## My hobbies and interests
I love photography! See my [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/blown_highlights) for some of the pictures I've taken. 

Like about half of the Bay Area, I love to snowboard. You can catch me up on the slopes at Heavenly/Northstar/Kirkwood 
at Lake Tahoe almost every weekend in the winter :)

A burgeoning interest of mine is retro computing. Living in Silicon Valley, where the personal computer revolution
began, has inspired me a lot (if you're ever in the area, you MUST check out the Computer History Museum). 
I currently own a Commodore 64, and am working on learning 6502 assembly :)
