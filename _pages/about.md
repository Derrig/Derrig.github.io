I have a passion for libre software and writing clean, performant code.

Languages I enjoy working with include **Java, OCaml, Javascript, and Python**. I am currently learning Kotlin and Vala.

This fall, I am beginning my senior year studying Computer Science at Cornell University. I plan to graduate in the spring of 2019.
